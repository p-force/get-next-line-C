# `üó£Ô∏è About`
> _The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor._

For detailed information, refer to the [subject](https://github.com/appinha/42cursus/tree/master/_PDFs) of this project.

`üöÄ TLDR`: this project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.

*Functions in get_next_line.c*

`ft_check_rem` - copy read excess (string after \n) to static variable (buffer).

`ft_back` - copy read line from buffer.

`get_next_line` - main function.

*Functions in get_next_line_utils.c*

`ft_strdup` - save a copy of a string (with malloc).

`ft_strjoin` - concatenate two strings into a new string (with malloc).

`ft_strcpy` - copy strings.

`ft_strchr` - locate character in string (first occurrence).

# `üõ†Ô∏è Usage`

### **Requirements**
The function is written in C language and thus needs the gcc compiler and some standard C libraries to run.

### **Instructions**

To use the function in your code, simply include its header:

```
#include "get_next_line.h"
```
and, when compiling your code, add the source files and the required flag:

```
get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -D BUFFER_SIZE=<size>
```
If you're on Linux, you may as well need the following flags:

```
-D ARG_MAX="sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)" -D OPEN_MAX=1024
```
### **üìã Running**
```
make
```
